This repo contains the assessment project for Udacity's Redux course, developed by React Training.

Projects are designed to showcase concepts that are important to using Redux with React. Both projects have an API server that serves as a backend for the React/Redux app. This is designed to give students a hands-on experience dealing with how data flows from the server to the client in various real-world scenarios.

There are currently 2 projects:

  1. Book Sharing - to be completed by students during the course
  2. Would you Rather - to be completed by students during the assessment

Additionally, there is a starter template for the assessment project in the [`would-you-rather`](would-you-rather) directory.

## Development

Both project require you to install and start the server as well as the local create react app project.

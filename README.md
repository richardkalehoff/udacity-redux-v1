This repo contains the assessment project for Udacity's Redux course, developed by React Training.

Projects are designed to showcase concepts that are important to using Redux with React. The main project has two API servers that serve as a backend for the React/Redux app. This is designed to give students a hands-on experience dealing with how data flows from the server to the client in various real-world scenarios.

There are currently 2 projects:

  1. [`contacts`](contacts) - to be completed by students during the course
  2. [`books`](books) - to be completed by students during the assessment

Additionally, there is a starter template for the assessment project in the [`books-starter`](books-starter) directory. This is a static HTML + CSS version of the final project that may serve as a starting point for students who don't want to write their own markup from scratch.

## Development

To start the would-you-rather project, you'll first need to start the "users api" as well as the "questions api". To do this, in the specific folders run

    $ npm install
    $ npm run start

Then start the client (would you rather) app in its directory (e.g. `would-you-rather`) using:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

A browser window will open automatically with the app.
